# Overview

A simple hdiutil wrapper for handling hard disk images in macOS.

Only those features required to work with shockpkg packages are implemented.

Currently mounting and ejecting disk images is supported.

Fully wrapping all available hdiutil features is out of scope for this project.

Only functions on macOS as it depends on the macOS hdiutil, but safe to import or require on all platforms.

# Usage

## Basic Usage

```js
import {Mounter} from '@shockpkg/hdi-mac';

const mounter = new Mounter();
const {devices, eject} = await mounter.attach('path/to/diskimage.dmg');
console.log(devices);
await eject();
```
